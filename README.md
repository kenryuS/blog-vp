# Blog in VuePress

After I made website for one of my club, I realized that I wasted time on not only that site, but also on [my blog site](https://github.com/kenryuS/blog).

After all, I didn't need any of these bs:

* Hand made CMS console
* Article tagging system
* CSS that is overwhelmingly hard to modify and extend
* Vercel
* Poorly structured Postgresql
* blah, blah, blah ...

All I needed was, zen-ful, easy to configure, extendable, static markdown site just like good old GitHub Pages + Jekyll setup.

You know ..., like ..., just let me have some break.

I still wanted to keep my favorite framework: Vue.js, so I choose VuePress as the solution to this chaos.

This will, I mean ***MUST*** be **the final** "personal blog website" that I will code.
